# What is Nightly? <a name="what-is-nightly"></a>

"Nightly" builds are builds of a program automatically generated by a computer at specific times

For Chatterino - all changes in between major releases are available on nightly (2.3.4 -> 2.3.5)

# Nightly Versions <a name="nightly-versions"></a>

### "Normal" Chatterino
The original version of nightly can be obtained here: 
[https://github.com/Chatterino/chatterino2/releases/tag/nightly-build](https://github.com/Chatterino/chatterino2/releases/tag/nightly-build) 

### 7TV Chatterino
The 7TV version of nightly adds support for the 3rd party emote service `7TV` - [https://7tv.app](https://7tv.app)  
- Due to the addition of 7TV to chatterino2 nightly, you only need to download chatterino7 if you'd like one of the following features:

		7TV Animated Profile Pictures
		7TV Paints (colorized names) 

It can be found here: [https://github.com/SevenTV/chatterino7/releases/tag/nightly-build](https://github.com/SevenTV/chatterino7/releases/tag/nightly-build)

### Pronoun Chatterino
The Pronoun version of nightly adds support for the `Twitch Chat Pronouns` extension 
created by: Alejo47 - [https://pronouns.alejo.io](https://pronouns.alejo.io) 
Needs to be toggled on in settings. (⚙️)

- **While this version of Chatterino works, it requires checking `every. single. user.` for pronouns one at a time, which will cause extreme load times for the pronouns if you have many channels open, and will appear as if the pronoun extension is not working.**

Both Normal and 7TV versions of this can be found here:

Normal - [https://github.com/GabeEddyT/chatterino2/releases/tag/nightly-build](https://github.com/GabeEddyT/chatterino2/releases/tag/nightly-build)

7TV - [https://github.com/GabeEddyT/chatterino2/releases/tag/nightly-build-7TV](https://github.com/GabeEddyT/chatterino2/releases/tag/nightly-build-7TV)

### Dankerino
While Dankerino does not have a specific third-party addition, like the prior 2 versions, it has many quality of life additions that may not have been accepted to the main version of Chatterino
\- More information can be found [here.](https://github.com/Mm2PL/dankerino#readme)

Dankerino supports both Normal and 7TV by offering the ability to disable 7TV
