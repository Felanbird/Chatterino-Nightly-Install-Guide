# How to Update Nightly <a name="how-to-update"></a>
Unlike the installer version of Chatterino which offers in-client updates, nightly versions do **not** automatically update. 
If there is a new feature you want, you re-download it the same way you did before.


# Chromebook & Linux <a name="chromebook-support"></a>
You are able to run Chatterino on a Chromebook, by utilizing it's built in Linux terminal, a guide on how to enable that can be found here: https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/9145439

After finishing installing Linux you can download the `AppImage` found highlighted in green in
[How-To-Download](#how-to-download)

Then execute the following 2 commands:
`chmod +x Chatterino-x86_64.AppImage` & `./Chatterino-x86_64.AppImage`
